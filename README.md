# Personal-Profile-Design-System
A mini project I did to strengthen my knowledge of foundational CSS  concepts 

This project solidified my knowledge of flexbox, which is really helpful in making your site appear fluid. 
In adition with media queries that target different screen sizes.

This project allowed me to practice with the font face property, importing fonts, and using multiple css selectors. 

I really emjoyed learning how the flex box works.
I encourage anyone that wants to understand flexboxes, CSS combinators and display properties to replicate this project.
